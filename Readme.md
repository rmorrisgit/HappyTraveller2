1. Install Homebrew (If Not Installed)

Hugo is best installed using Homebrew. If you don’t have Homebrew installed, run this command in the terminal:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

2. Install Hugo

Once Homebrew is installed, use the following command to install Hugo:

brew install hugo

3. Verify Installation

Check if Hugo is installed correctly by running:

hugo version

This should output the installed Hugo version, confirming a successful installation.
Alternative Installation: Download Binary

If you prefer not to use Homebrew, you can manually download Hugo:

Go to the official Hugo Releases page.

Download the macOS binary (hugo_extended_x.x.x_macOS-universal.tar.gz).

Extract the archive and move the hugo binary to /usr/local/bin:

tar -xvzf hugo_extended_x.x.x_macOS-universal.tar.gz


mv hugo /usr/local/bin/

Verify installation using:

hugo version
